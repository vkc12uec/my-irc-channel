my-irc-channel:
---------------

This code is written to build a simple platform where clients connect to a specified channel# and start communition in irc-fashion.


Design:
-------

Server listens on a socket. As soon a new client connects, server checks if there is already a child corresponding to that channel#.
  If yes, then server routes the new client filedesc. to that child
  Else it spawn a child who is responsible for relaying messsages b/w clients who use the same channel#.

So, child <===> channel# is 1:1 relationship.
    server <===> child is 1:M relationship.
